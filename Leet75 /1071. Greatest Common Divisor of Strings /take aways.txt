n this code, the Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of str1 and str2. Let's break down how it's applied:

Initialize with Lengths:

len(str1) and len(str2) represent the lengths of str1 and str2, respectively.
These lengths are used as the initial values of a and b in the find_gcd function.
While Loop with find_gcd Function:

The find_gcd function implements the Euclidean algorithm using a while loop.
The loop continues as long as b is not zero. This is because the algorithm repeatedly calculates remainders until b becomes zero.
Division and Remainder:

Inside the loop, the code performs the division a = b and b = a % b. This step is crucial in the Euclidean algorithm.
The % operator calculates the remainder of the division, and the result is assigned to b.
This division and remainder calculation effectively replaces a with b and b with the remainder b. This step is repeated until b becomes zero.
